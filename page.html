                    <p class="card-text">Sixty percent of all suicides are committed by people with mood disorders. Mood disorders are a broad category of mental illness that includes major depression and bipolar disorder (an illness characterized by shifts between low levels of mood and energy to high levels of mood and energy), and other conditions including dysthymia (a long-term, low-grade level of depression), cyclothymia (a milder form of bipolar disorder) and schizoaffective disorder (an illness with a combination of psychotic thinking and mood problems).People who are just emerging from a prolonged depressive episode are particularly at risk of committing suicide. There is little energy to plan and implement a suicide in the depths of depression. However, as depressive symptoms begin to wane, more energy is available for such planning. In addition, physical symptoms of depression (e.g., fatigue) frequently resolve faster than cognitive symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation), so a person may have more energy to carry out self-destructive thoughts. Adding alcohol to the equation (which may also cloud thinking) significantly increases the suicide risk of people with mood disorders.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Suicide rates increased approximately 36% between 2000–2021. Suicide was responsible for 48,183 deaths in 2021, which is about one death every 11 minutes. The number of people who think about or attempt suicide is even higher. In 2021, an estimated 12.3 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.5 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.7 million attempted suicide.

                        Suicide affects people of all ages. In 2021, suicide was among the top 9 leading causes of death for people ages 10-64. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and 20-34.3</p>

                    <h2 class="card-title">How can society raise awareness of this issue and support others?</h2>
      
                    <p class="card-text">Anyone can help raise awareness during World Suicide Prevention Day. Participation could be a simple conversation with a friend or family member, an online #WSPD post, or a workplace event.

                        What matters is that the issue is talked about to help reduce the stigma around suicide, and we can support our friends, families and colleagues who may be experiencing a crisis or are bereaved by suicide. Here are some ideas to think about on World Suicide Prevention Day. Promote mental health awareness in the workplace or host a World Suicide Prevention Day event. There are many organisations who can provide advice for establishing better mental health in your workplace. Check out Black Dog Institute’s six ways to contribute to wellbeing at work. Reach out to a mate or family member if you think they’re struggling. Take the time to speak to them, listen to what’s going on, ask questions and show them you’re there to provide support. Listen non-judgmentally when someone opens up about their worries and concerns. Make it clear that it’s ok to talk it out. Do not ignore or talk down to them, don’t tell them to get over it, or instantly ‘take over’ the discussion and relate it back to yourself. Good communication is as much about listening as it is about talking.
